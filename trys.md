## About Me

I'm a passionate technologist driven by the thrill of exploring cutting-edge technology. My work spans across:
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** – Building intelligent systems and leveraging data-driven insights.
- **Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking** – Securing systems through rigorous vulnerability analysis and penetration testing.
- **Arduino & IoT** – Creating innovative, interactive projects with smart devices.
- **Reverse Engineering & Assembly** – Diving deep into binaries and low-level code to understand system internals.
- **Kernel Driver Security** – Developing and securing system-level drivers for robust computing environments.

I blend creativity with technical prowess to push the boundaries of modern technology.
